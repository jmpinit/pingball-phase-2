The following document explains manual tests that were done to test features that could not easily be automated. 

Portal physics correctness was testing by the board simplePortal.pb. The ball should go directly into the Alpha portal, 
pop out of the Beta portal, enter the absorber, and then bounce on the right hand side of the screen indefinitely. 

Testing for boards traveling to different boards via portals was done with portalPairA.pb and portalPairB.pb.
If a portal on one board cannot detect that the other board on which its other portal resides, then it does 
not affect the ball at all. This was tested by only opening portalPairA.pb. The ball passes straight through
the portal and hits the absorber and then bounces on the right hand side of the screen indefinitely.

Testing for multiple clients and concurrency issues was done by running the PingballServer and then opening
multiple PingballGUIs with different boards. All the boards continue to work even with six boards concurrently open.
